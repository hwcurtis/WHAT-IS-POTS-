WHAT IS POTS - CAPSTONE

When I started this CAPSTONE, I was determined to find information on POTS, a disease people truly don't understand. Unfortunately, it is increasing quicker than can be explained. 
I myself see this. I personally know three families that have a child diagnosed with this debilitating disease… My own child does not have POTS as severe as some, and for that and 
We are thankful. However, it has certainly changed her life. She was very active- playing soccer, softball, and dancing and playing piano all through middle school- and now she 
sometimes does not want to get up because she is too tired. Bike rides are not “fun anymore” because too long on the bike makes her heart race, and to recuperate from that is 
exhausting. Brain Fog is a horrible thing. Think of an older person with dementia having a really bad day: that is her during brain fog. Sometimes, she is not even able to convey 
what she wants to say. The following will show some symptoms and issues that we have encountered, but not all are properly diagnosed. I did find some studies, but they were mostly 
volunteer groups trying to help one another cope with the issues.

I did find that Covid is partial to blame for this disease, as well as dysautonomia, which is a more general diagnosis similar to POTS.

I used medical CSV sets and research to conduct this report while using Python and Tableau to put things together to maybe explain an extraordinary girl's life with POTS and the 
effects. These are not all of the symptoms, because she does not always share everything…

I feel my research has “scraped the top points” of this disease, while not reaching every aspect of POTS… I am thankful that my girl has a less severe case, if there is truly such 
a thing as “less severe”. Any disease that disrupts a life is life changing. I know of a few families other than ours, that are just now realizing that is (unfortunately) one more 
thing we have in common, other than all of them being girls (research shows women are more likely to have POTS or Dysautonomia than males). There are variations of this and I 
chose to focus on what was an everyday challenge in our lives. I have more knowledge about POTS than I did before. However, I already knew that there is no cure, and some have 
worse symptoms than others. In the research I studied, it was found that 25% of people with POTS cannot even go to school or keep a job,THAT being said, my girl was the 
Valedictorian of 2023 (before we were aware of her diagnosis). In 2008 there was a new law put into place to make accommodations for people with Dysautonomia.

So, while my project may not move, I do have an interactive in Tableau  to help show a snippet of the cause Covid has had to prompt this life-changing disease, and the similar 
symptoms between Covid, POTS, and dysautonomia.

In closing, I just have one thing to say. I hope it works. I've learned more than I would have expected, and I changed many different directions in this project. I have created 
different folders; I hope all work in my favor in the end… Ive shocked and awed more than one person, so if nothing else, the experience has been for the better, and I have 
learned much. 

LAST BUT NOT LEAST   Please forgive if too many folders, or repeating Information, there is a reason for the madness and I was told various sources were allowed.. The Struggle 
was real in finding information just on POTS ......

DOWNLOADING MY GIT HUB REPO

TO DOWNLOAD my GITHUB "what is pots": [https://github.com/hwcurtis/WHAT-IS-POTS-.git](https://github.com/hwcurtis/WHAT-IS-POTS-.git)

Cloning this repo is as simple as , going to git hub.com waiting for it to load onto your screen  and looking for hwcurtis, once you sign in , there will be a spot that ask you 
what "TOP REPOSITORIES" you are looking for  ... PLEASE enter - hwcurtis/WHAT -IS -POTS , that will then open a screen, when you see a button that says code, please click on the 
down arrow and copy the code,  from there , you copy  , then open the File Explorer, possibly double clicking, depending on your system.. a list will drop down with a little black 
box (open in terminal)  clicking on that once should show a cursor in a black box , with possibly a c and some sort of information...At the > type git clone and then paste the 
address and hit enter . There will be a drop down and it will show you  "cloning into "  WHAT IS POTS  or may just say you have cloned a folder "WHAT IS POTS" from there  hit the 
X on the top right of the box and open Visual studio code ... Go to FILE  open a folder "what is pots " which will then show you all the files in the folder....HAPPY DOWNLOADING 

This project will give you examples of research and numbers of people affected by COVID, POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia ) symptoms and Dysautonomia , all related to 
POTS

Technologie USED  = PANDAS to manipulate and clean  the CSV  files and data , which then was converted into  Jupyter Notebooks application, per requirements of this project. I Also used, a "chart friendly"  "Tableau" which I hope will help to show the effects these diseases have had over the years ...

All of this being said,As mentioned earlier, I had 0 knowledge or experience on the tech side before now, so I hope my explanation of finding my NOTEBOOK displays were easy and 
 not "clear as mud " so to speak.... 

  TABLEAU  access is a bit easier and works to my advantage, because I sure did not know what “GITHUB” or python/pandas were either.. .But tableau is much easier to access from my link

When you click on this link it has a drop down with a more compact link and allows you to actually copy the link if you wish or just click one more time and it will take you to the first page, which is interactive , by moving the cursor over the states, that will give  you information. There are tabs on the top of the page  to switch to another screen and more information.
