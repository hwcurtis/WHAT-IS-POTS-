WHAT IS POTS - CAPSTONE

When I started this CAPSTONE, I was determined to find information on POTS, a disease people truly don't understand. Unfortunately, it is increasing quicker than can be explained. I myself see this. I personally know three families that have a child diagnosed with this debilitating disease… My own child does not have POTS as severe as some, and for that and we are thankful. However, it has certainly changed her life. She was very active- playing soccer, softball, and dancing and playing piano all through middle school- and now she sometimes does not want to get up because she is too tired. Bike rides are not “fun anymore” because too long on the bike makes her heart race, and to recuperate from that is exhausting. Brain Fog is a horrible thing. Think of an older person with dementia having a really bad day: that is her during brain fog. Sometimes, she is not even able to convey what she wants to say. The following will show some symptoms and issues that we have encountered, but not all are properly diagnosed. I did find some studies, but they were mostly volunteer groups trying to help one another cope with the issues.

I did find that Covid is partial to blame for this disease, as well as dysautonomia, which is a more general diagnoses similar to POTS.

I used medical CSV sets and research to conduct this report while using Python and Tableau to put things together to maybe explain an extraordinary girl's life with POTS and the effects. These are not all of the symptoms, because she does not always share everything…

I feel my research has “scraped the top points” of this disease, while not reaching every aspect of POTS… I am thankful that my girl has a less severe case, if there is truly such a thing as “less severe”. Any disease that disrupts a life is life changing. I know of a few families other than ours, that are just now realizing that is (unfortunately) one more thing we have in common, other than all of them being girls (research shows women are more likely to have POTS or Dysautonomia than males). There are variations of this and I chose to focus on what was an everyday challenge in our lives. I have more knowledge about POTS than I did before. However, I already knew that there is no cure, and some have worse symptoms than others. In the research I studied, it was found that 25% of people with POTS cannot even go to school or keep a job,THAT being said, my girl was the Valedictorian of 2023 (before we were aware of her diagnosis). In 2008 there was a new law put into place to make accommodations for people with Dysautonomia.

So, while my project may not move, I do have an interactive in Tableau  to help show a snippet of the cause Covid has had to prompt this life-changing disease, and the similar symptoms between Covid, POTS, and dysautonomia.

In closing, I just have one thing to say. I hope it works. I've learned more than I would have expected, and I changed many different directions in this project. I have created different folders; I hope all work in my favor in the end… Ive shocked and awed more than one person, so if nothing else, the experience has been for the better, and I have learned much. 

LAST BUT NOT LEAST   Please forgive if too many folders, or repeating Information, there is a reason to the madness and I was told Various sources were allowed.. The Struggle 
was real in finding information just on POTS ......

I used Pandas to manipulate the dataset and required to use NOTEBOOK to display 

Tableau was also used, to help "display" the effects Covid has had over the USA in the past and to this date..

All of this being said, I do hope you enjoy the interactive map and charts in Tableau, and I hope you can forgive any repeated folders having both CSV extension, as well as IPYNB for Jupiter Notes. As mentioned earlier, I had 0 knowledge or experience on the tech side before now, and I was not quite sure how to go about having two different files in one project.
